          <p>CGL m360 will take measures to protect your personal information. This policy outlines how we handle the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information. Our policy is guided by the provincial and federal privacy laws applicable in Canada.</p>
          <h5 class="shortcode-heading bordered text- left">WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</h5>
          <p>In the course of conducting business with you, CGL m360 will collect information from you such as: your name, title, company or organization, address, telephone number, fax number, email address and photograph. If you participate in our surveys or contests, your survey opinion and submissions for our contests will be collected. If you provide your resume to us through, for instance, the Careers section of our website, we will also collect this information. If you engage us to create ID cards we will collect information about those for whom we are making cards that may include information such as name, employee number, date of employment. If you participate in a training course, your personal information will be collected as well as identification required by provincial governments if the course is a precursor to licencing. On our website, we may collect your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address and cookies. Your “IP address” is a unique 32-bit numeric address that distinguishes your computer from another computer. “Cookies” are small text files that contain information about you, such as your user name and password, which are stored on the web browser of your computer. CGL m360 uses a high encryption algorithm on its cookies so that only our server can read and decrypt the contents within it and other parties will not be able to access such information.</p>
